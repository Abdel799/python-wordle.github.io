Welcome to my wordle project, this is essentially my own version of the real life wordle game. The rules are simple: the user gets five chances to guess a five letter word,
if the letters in the user's guessed word are in the unknown word and in the EXACT same position, they will light up green. If the letters are not in the exact same position but
are still in the unknown word, they will light up red. Otherwise the letters will light up grey indicating they don't exist in the unknown word. If the user fails to guess the
word within five guesses they will automatically lose.
